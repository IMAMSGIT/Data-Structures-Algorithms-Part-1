// Each array of integers need 4 bytes memory
// So, looking up array by index is super fast
// Also, for this , runtime complexity is O(1)
// Problem
// Java and many other language arrays are static 
// we should specify their size
// if we don't know the size of array, space will be unused
// if we add new array, we have to
// copy previous array and complexity proportionate to O(n)
// If we want to remove last item , best case, complexity is O(1)
// But when removing the first item, have to shift total array right to left
// Its complexity is O(n)
