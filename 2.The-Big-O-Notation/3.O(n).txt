// Here the exeacution time increases 
As the input of the numbers array increases 
Linked to it linearly,
Marked as O(n),
and It is true for any type of loop
// note that if we add 2 print statements before or 
after the loop, it doesn't matter
// Also if ther is 2 loop 
// same because complecity goes up related to input size linearly
