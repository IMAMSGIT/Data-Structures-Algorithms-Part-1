Used to store items sequentially
Unlike array it can grow and shrink

Each node holds two pieces of data 
one is value and other is the address of the next node

each node poins to next node
first node is called "Head" and last is "Tail"

LookUP->Time complexity

seach a value O(n), as to search all the value
search by Index O(n), because they are all over the memory
Unlike array not next to each other
So, worst is we have to traverse all of them

Insert(at the end) O(1) , the Tail should point the last node
Insert(at the beginning) O(1) , create a empty node, point to the 2nd node,change head to the first 
Insert(in the middle) O(n) , we have to find where to add and then update

Delete(from the beginning) O(1), head to point the 2nd node and unlink from the second object
Delete(from the end) O(n), traverse all, ASA we recognize the last node, we keep reference it as the last node
then we'll unlink the node and point head to refer the previous node

Delete(from the middle) O(n), we have travel all to find the middle and also the previous one
then we link the node after the next of the middle node and remove the middle node
